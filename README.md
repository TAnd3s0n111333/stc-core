# STC Core

**Standard Template Construct — Core Definitions and Standards**

## Overview

`stc-core` defines the **foundational architecture, interfaces, and standards** of the Standard Template Construct (STC).  
It formalises how engineering knowledge, modules, environments, and planning concepts are represented across the STC ecosystem.

This repository acts as the **reference standard** for all other STC components.

## Scope

This repository contains:
- Core architectural definitions
- Module interface standards
- Knowledge representation schemas
- Planning and constraint abstractions
- Versioning and development rules

This repository deliberately avoids implementation-heavy code.

## What This Repository Is Not

- A simulation engine  
- A robotics control stack  
- A machine learning training repository  
- A finished product  

Implementations live in downstream repositories.
