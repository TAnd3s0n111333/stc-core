# stc-core
STC Core formalizes the foundational architecture, standards, and interfaces of the Standard Template Construct (STC).  It specifies how engineering knowledge, modules, environments, and planning abstractions are represented, versioned, and composed across the STC system. This repository is the authoritative reference for all STC-compatible tools.
